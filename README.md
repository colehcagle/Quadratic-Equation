# Quadratic-Equation
This is a program that uses C++ to execute input/output and calls an Intel x86 assembly language program to execute the calculations of the quadratic equation.
If the roots are imaginery (value under radical is negative), the program will output the roots are imaginery. If 0 is entered for A, it will return an error because
the denominator cannot equal 0. Outside of those exceptions, both roots will be returned in decimal form.
